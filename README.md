Welcome to the Science Gallery Booking System! This system aims to streamline the process of managing bookings for various engaging and educational experiences offered to secondary school groups. These experiences include free gallery tours and paid interactive workshops.

## Background

The Science Gallery provides diverse educational experiences for secondary school groups, from free gallery tours to paid workshops like drone flying and 3D bone assembly. However, managing booking requests has become challenging due to their various sources (calls, Microsoft platforms, email) and the complexity of finalizing bookings across multiple venues with differing requirements. With numerous programs and teams using different booking forms and software, the process is labor-intensive, handling hundreds of appointments annually, including cancellations. To streamline operations, the Science Gallery seeks to enhance its system by accurately recording bookings, actions required, and improving workflow efficiency.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive booking management system for the Science Gallery, aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and improving user experience for both partner and non-partner school teachers. This system will enable teachers to easily book programs, manage bookings, and access educational experiences, while providing Science Gallery staff with the necessary tools to streamline booking processes, manage resources effectively, and ensure accurate record-keeping. Additionally, the system will support the expansion of program offerings, facilitate space management, and enable data-driven decision-making through comprehensive reporting capabilities. Overall, the goal is to create a user-friendly, efficient, and scalable platform that enhances the educational outreach efforts of the Science Gallery and optimizes the visitor experience.
